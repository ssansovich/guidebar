  <h1>Causal Entropic Forces</h1>
  <h2>Subheader 1 does this work when the text is very long???</h2>
  Recent advances in fields ranging from cosmology to computer science have hinted at a possible deep con- nection between intelligence and entropy maximization. In cosmology, the causal entropic principle for anthropic selection has used the maximization of entropy production in causally connected space-time regions as a thermody- namic proxy for intelligent observer concentrations in the prediction of cosmological parameters.
